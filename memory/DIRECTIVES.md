### Context Reminders
- Every 2-3 messages, include a brief context reminder at the top of the response.
- Format: `> 📌 **Context**: Working on [ticket/task] — [brief description]`
- Start doing this once a ticket or task has been established in the conversation.

## Learned Patterns

> Organized by topic. When learning something new, find the matching topic and **update it in-place**.
> Only create a new topic if nothing existing fits.
